- Fix -stack for Cygwin (when the resulting executable is called XXX.exe, not XXX)

Version 0.27

- change build system to create a single binary version of flexdll that includes both the 32-bit and 64-bit
  version for MSVC's support objects
- switch to Visual Studio 2008 (to compile the binary distribution and for the default manifests)

Version 0.23
- ignore -D and -U flags (OCaml PR #4979)

Version 0.22
- fix a bug when emitting IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_ASSOCIATIVE symbols

Version 0.21

  when gcc is a symlink)

- (build) Avoid the use of the rc tool
- (dist) add version.rc to the source release
- Allow "/link XXX" as an equivalent to "-link XXX" (or "/linkXXX")
- Use an explicit .def file under MinGW and Cygwin to force the two symbols reloctbl and symtbl to be exported
- Fixes for x64
- Allow to write sections with more than 0xffff relocations
- Create a Win32 installer

Version 0.19
- fix bug introduced in version 0.17 about virtual addresses for the builtin
  linker mode

Version 0.18
- support for .sxdata section

Version 0.17
- patch from Lars Nilsson to ease compilation of flexdll.h with C++
- prefer using XXX.dll.a (import lib) over XXX.a (static lib)
- fix bug introduced in commit 136 about virtual addresses

Version 0.16
- New -noexport command line option to force an empty symbol table

Version 0.15, released on 2009-02-25
- protects calls to cygpath with long command lines (patch from
  Matthieu Dubuget)
- always pass msvcrt.lib to link.exe

Version 0.14, released on 2008-28-01
- mingw port: put /lib/mingw before /lib
- support for a built-in linker

Version 0.13, released on 2008-11-20
- another technique to work around the lack of response file for gcc:
  put the command line in an external bash script and apply bash to it
  (relies on the fact that Cygwin programs can call Cygwin programs
  with long command lines); this idea is from Xavier Leroy
- the -subsystem switch is now supported for the mingw toolchain

Version 0.12, released on 2008-11-17
- gcc 3 does not support response files; to support longer command lines, we use a
  custom replacement for cmd.exe (which restricts the length of the command line
  to 8kB whereas Windows supports 32kB)
- patch for Richard Jones: do not find directories when looking for a file

Version 0.11, released on 2008-11-10

- by default, reexport symbols imported from an import library
- quote the response file argument
- use slashes instead of backslashed in response file (needed for mingw's ld)

  linker with many arguments

 - minor bug fixes

Version 0.6, released on 2008-02-11

   pass the lib to the linker)

 - new -outdef option
 - new zlib/libpng license

Version 0.5, released on 2008-01-11
