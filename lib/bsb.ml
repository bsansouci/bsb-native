                We can't really serialize that tree inside a file and avoid checking
                each dep one by one because that cache could go stale if one modifies
                something inside a dep directly. We could use such a cache for when
                the compiler's not invoked with `-make-world` but it's unclear if it's 
                worth doing.
                
                One way that might make this faster is to avoid parsing all of the bsconfig
                and just grab what we need. 
                
                Another way, which might be generally beneficial, is to generate
                a faster representation of bsconfig that's more liner. If we put the 
                most used information at the top and mashalled, it would be the "fastest"
                thing to do (that I can think of off the top of my head).
