   This module is used to check whether [build.ninja] needs
   be regenerated. Everytime [bsb] run [regenerate_ninja], 
   bsb will try to [check] if it is needed, 
   if needed, bsb will regenerate ninja file and store the 
   metadata again

(** [record cwd file relevant_file_or_dirs]
    The data structure we decided to whether regenerate [build.ninja] 
    or not. 
    Note that if we don't record absolute path,  ninja will not notice  its build spec changed, 
    it will not trigger  rebuild behavior, 
    It may not be desired behavior, since there is some subtlies here (__FILE__ or __dirname)

    We serialize such data structure and call {!check} to decide
    [build.ninja] should be regenerated
